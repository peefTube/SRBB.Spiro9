# Spiro9's Better Build

This is my personal BB repo to update over time and get used to how Unity programming works, while also potentially providing something the community might be able to use. I will have to spend a lot of time running over the code and getting everything working, but hopefully I can implement some things.

# BetterBuildPublic

Public release of the BetterBuild mod.

A lot of references to code used has been lost. To run the mod you need to implement a modloader (check Loaders/Custom.cs)

The code has been slightly cleaned up. There might be bugs tho. Use with caution :p

Thank you all for the years of fun on Slime Rancher Modding â™¥
